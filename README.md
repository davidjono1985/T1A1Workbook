# T1A1 - WORKBOOK
#### By David Johnson

## QUESTION 1
Five key events:

* 1983 Domain Name System (DNS) pioneered by Jon Postel, Paul Mockapetris and Craig Partridge. Seven 'top-level' domain names are initially introduced: edu, com, gov, mil, net, org and int.

* 1986: Protocol wars
The so-called Protocol wars began in 1986. European countries at that time were pursuing the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI), while the United States was using the Internet/Arpanet protocol, which eventually won out.* 1987: The Internet grows
By 1987, there were nearly 30,000 hosts on the Internet. The original Arpanet protocol had been limited to 1,000 hosts, but the adoption of the TCP/IP standard made larger numbers of hosts possible.

* 1989 also brought about the proposal for the World Wide Web, written by Tim Berners-Lee. It was originally published in the March issue of MacWorld, and then redistributed in May 1990. It was written to persuade CERN that a global hypertext system was in CERN’s best interest. It was originally called “Mesh”; the term “World Wide Web” was coined while Berners-Lee was writing the code in 1990.* 1990 The Internet, World Wide Web & Tim Berners-Lee
Tim Berners-Lee and Robert Cailliau propose a 'hypertext' system starting the modern Internet * 1991	The World Wide Web: The World Wide Web is launched to the public on August 6, 1991

* 1993: Introducing Mosaic – first graphical web browser for the general public.  The first widely downloaded Internet browser, Mosaic, was released in 1993. While Mosaic wasn’t the first web browser, it is considered the first browser to make the Internet easily accessible to non-techies.
The Mosaic web browser had been released the year before, and public interest turned to what was formerly the domain of academics and technology geeks. Web pages began springing up, and people everywhere began realizing the enormous possibilities of an interconnected network that spanned the globe. These early websites were more like an interactive word document than anything else, but combined with popularity of email, Internet relay chat channels and BBS-centric message boards, they became a great way for people to stay connected to friends and family and business to reach a broader audience.

* 1995: Commercialization of the internet
1995 is often considered the first year the web became commercialized. While there were commercial enterprises online prior to ’95, there were a few key developments that happened that year. First, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) encryption was developed by Netscape, making it safer to conduct financial transactions (like credit card payments) online. In addition, two major online businesses got their start the same year. The first sale on “Echo Bay” was made that year. Echo Bay later became eBay. Amazon.com also started in 1995, though it didn’t turn a profit for six years, until 2001.
